# Given the following function
```
function grandpa(){
    var playball = "homerun";

    function dad(){
        var playball = "touchdown";

        function son(){
            var playnintendo = "Mario";
        }   
    }

    function uncle(){        
        var badjoke = "Har";

        function cousin(){

        }
    }
}
```

Remove entries from the array until only correct answers remain

These function(s) access the playball variable and get homerun
var scopeArray1 = ["grandpa", "dad", "son", "uncle", "cousin"];

These function(s) access the playball variable and get touchdown
var scopeArray2 = ["grandpa", "dad", "son", "uncle", "cousin"];

These function(s) access the badjoke variable and get undefined
var scopeArray3 = ["grandpa", "dad", "son", "uncle", "cousin"];

These functions accesss the badjoke variable and get "Har"
var scopeArray4 = ["grandpa", "dad", "son", "uncle", "cousin"];

These functions access the playnintendo variable and get Mario
var scopeArray5 = ["grandpa", "dad", "son", "uncle", "cousin"];


`var foo;`
Promises
  Write a function called async.
  Use $q to create a promise object and return the promise.
  Call setTimeout on a function
  which changes the variable foo (above) to 'bar'
  Resolve the promise when setTimeout completes.

Context
# Context 1
Write a function called context1 that takes in 4 parameters: A function called myFn, an object called context, param1, and param2.
Invoke myFn explicitly setting the context to the object called context.  Pass in param1 and param2 in order as well.

# Context 2
Write a function called context2 that takes in 3 parameters: A function called myFn, an object called context, and an array called params
Invoke myFn explicitly setting the context to the object called context.  Pass in params

# Context 3
Write a function called context3 that takes in 2 parameters: A function called myFn, and an object called context
Make sure the function is permanently linked to the context.  This should give you a new function, return it.

Call - Take in 1 function, an object that is the context and 3 params and invoke the function with the context and the parameters
Apply -  Take in 1 function, an object, and array of parameters and invoke the function with the context and the parameters
Bind - Take in 1 function and an object and return a new function that can be invoked as much as we want with the object as the context function

# Constructor Function
Make a constructor function called taco that takes in 3 parameters: shell, meat, veggies and assigns them to identically named properties.

# Implicit binding
Make a constructor function called burrito.  It has a property called percentLeft = 100.  It has a property called eat that is a function.  When eat is invoked it uses context to implicitly subract 25 from the percentLeft on the burrito.


# Prototype 1
Add prototype function to the array type that doubles the value of every item in the array

# Prototype 2
Write a constructor function called chimichanga.  It has a property called percentLeft = 100.  It has a prototype function called eat.  When eat is invoked it uses context to implicitly subract 20 from the precentLeft on the chimichanga.


# Closure 1
Write a function called sentence machine.  It takes in a parameter called partOne.  It returns a function called sentenceSmasher.
When sentenceSmasher is invoked it should take in a parameter called partTwo and return a new string that adds partOne and partTwo together.  

# Closure 2
Write a function called subway.  It takes in one parameter called personName.  
It needs to keep track of what ingredients the person wants on their sandwhich.
It needs to do this by returning a function called addIngredient.  
When addIngredient is invoked it saves that ingredient with previously added ingredients and then returns an object that looks like this (Replace the parts wrapped in <> with correct data):
```
{
    orderPerson: <Person name goes here>,
    ingredients: <Array of ingredients goes here>
}
```

# Type checking
Write a function that takes in 2 parameters.
If both parameters are the same type an the same value return "Exact match".
If both parameters have the same value but are different types return "Different types"
Otherwise return "Different values"
